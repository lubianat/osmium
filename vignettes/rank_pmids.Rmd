# Basic Usage

From a list of self-curated PMIDs, I want to get the most bang for my buck.

My buck is time, and the bang is the influence of an article.

Let`s run osmium and see which docs have a high citation/page score.

```{r setup}
library(europepmc)
library(osmium)

a <- epmc_search('"concept of cell type"')
pmids = a$id

df <- run_multiple_osmium(pmids, density_alpha = 1)

df <- df[order(df$osmium),]

df.head()
```
